# particle-space-simulator (with compute shaders)
This is one of my newer projects. It's a space simulator that is supposed to simulate gravity in space (imagine orbits and forming of planets).
Each particle is represented with one pixel. One particle has a mass, a position and a direction vector. 

You can find a video of the simulation [HERE](https://youtu.be/mP9KssUn2KQ)
